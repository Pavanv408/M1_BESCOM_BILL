# REQUIREMENTS

## INTRODUCTION

* The BESCOM Power Bill calculator project is the application based mini project, it is used to predict the power bill of next month by taking input of appliance or load(kva) used. 
* The tool used for developing application and writting  the code,  is Microsoft visual studio code. 

* This project has multifile and multiplatform approach ( works on both Linux and Windows).

# RESEARCH

###### This project is going to be very helpful for the People who don’t have  knowledge of calculating BESCOM Power bill, can use this application to predict electricity bill of upcoming days and months. 
however, the defining features of an BESCOM Power bill calculator include:

_ Power charges on loads
_ Total load draw calculation
_ Unit consumed per day
_ Units consumed per month

For enhancing the project additionaly functions and Features was Added:

* Power bill calculation in Town & City areas
* Power bill calculation in Village areas
* Power bill calculation based on no of units consumed


Defining System:

Design and testing operations of electricity bill calculator using unit testing algorithm.

SWOT analysis:

Strengths: Innovative, User-friendly.

Weakness: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.

Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. So tech based market always attracts the youth.

Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.
