# REQUIREMENTS

## INTRODUCTION

* The BESCOM Power Bill calculator project is the application based mini project, it is used to predict the power bill of next month by taking input of appliance or load(kva) used. 
* The tool used for developing application and writting  the code,  is Microsoft visual studio code. 

* This project has multifile and multiplatform approach ( works on both Linux and Windows).

# RESEARCH

###### This project is going to be very helpful for the People who don’t have  knowledge of calculating BESCOM Power bill, can use this application to predict electricity bill of upcoming days and months. 
however, the defining features of an BESCOM Power bill calculator include:

_ Power charges on loads
_ Total load draw calculation
_ Unit consumed per day
_ Units consumed per month

as we all of know that power supply for agricultural activites and usage is totally free so in this project 
For high-end electricity bill and enhancing the project additionaly functions and Features was added :

* Power bill calculation in Town & City areas
* Power bill calculation in Village areas
* Power bill calculation based on no of units consumed


# Defining System:

Design and testing the  operations of  Bescom Power bill calculator using unit testing algorithm.

SWOT analysis:

* Strengths:Easy, Innovative, User-friendly.

* Weakness: Became complex and Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increases .

* Opportunities: We all know that we mostly use book and Pen for calculation. So the new technology based apps are always attracts the people.

* Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.
